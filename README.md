# PROJECT ASSIGNMENT 1
Description = The Virtual Pet Simulator is like a computer game where you take care of a pet. It's made using a computer programming language C#. In the game, you can pick a type of pet (like a cat, dog, or rabbit) and give it a name. After creating your virtual pet, you can do different things to take care of it, like feeding it, playing with it, and letting it rest.
This project is made to help you learn important programming ideas, such as how to organize a program, talk to the computer screen, use different kinds of information, change one kind of information into another, and make decisions in the program.
INSTRUCTIONS = 1. Utilize the C# programming language within the Visual Studio environment to create code for a virtual pet simulator. Ensure that the code incorporates Pet Care Actions, encompassing the following functionalities:
   - Feeding: Reduces hunger while slightly increasing health.
   - Playing: Boosts happiness, with a slight increase in hunger.
   - Resting: Enhances health but slightly decreases happiness.
   Ensure that each action modifies the pet's statistics accordingly and provides a descriptive message detailing the impact of the action.

2. Execute the code, and if the execution is successful...

3. Integrate the project into a GitHub repository...

4. Produce a video demonstrating the functionality and operation of the virtual pet simulator and upload it to YouTube...

5. Include the YouTube video link in the README.md file...
